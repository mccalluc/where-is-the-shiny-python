Looking for:
- Python backend
- Web frontend
- Dashboard UI: No code shown in frontend
- Dashboard UI: Multiple linked visualizations
- Extensible
- Performant with large datasets

Cells can be arranged in grids, rather than occupying the full width. Project had initial funding from IBM, then lost energy.

# Comparisons

## [Bokeh vs. Dash](https://blog.sicara.com/bokeh-dash-best-dashboard-framework-python-shiny-alternative-c5b576375f7f): January 30, 2018
> I would use Dash by default:
> - it uses plotly for python which makes it very powerful
> - it uses React on the frontend which makes it easy add components
> - I coded more easily on Dash than on Bokeh, which confirms the opinion of other users I cited
>
> If you’re still unsure about which one to choose:
> - Do a POC on Dash of your most critical features
> - Do a POC on Bokeh if you got blocked by a lack of interactions between graphs (like panning multiple graphs at the same time)
> - Then decide if you want to sacrifice some features to use Dash or if you’re fine with Bokeh

## [Shiny vs. Dash](https://www.rkingdc.com/blog/2019/3/6/shiny-vs-dash-a-side-by-side-comparison): March 6, 2019
> Shiny is a sleek, feature rich framework. It lowers the barrier to entry for creating rich interactive web apps but is also hackable, for those who want to build something complex and customized and who have the will to hammer though. The Shiny community is awesome.
>
> Dash is pretty new and still a little rough around the edges. It was built to be customized, so those who love hacking and tweaking may find a friend in Dash. And since it is built on Python and Flask, the ecosystem available for use in Dash apps is already huge.
